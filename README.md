Betty is an AI agent for sports betting with friends on Discord. It creates bets using smart contracts on Arbitrum Stylus, manages deposits via Metamask, and automates payouts with Chainlink resultsâ€”making group betting seamless and trustless.

## Features
- **Smart Contract Integration:** Bets are secured with Arbitrum Stylus smart contracts.
- **Web3 Transactions:** Manages deposits and payouts via Metamask.
- **Automated Payouts:** Uses Chainlink to fetch match results and distribute funds.
- **Seamless Discord Experience:** No need for a traditional frontend; everything happens within Discord.
- **Trustless Betting:** No intermediaries, ensuring fairness and transparency.

## How It Works
1. **Create a Bet:** A user sets up a bet in Discord with Betty's guidance.
2. **Smart Contract Deployment:** Betty generates a smart contract and a unique betting link.
3. **Friends Join:** Users place their bets using Metamask.
4. **Match Result Fetching:** Chainlink provides verified match results.
5. **Payout Distribution:** The smart contract automatically distributes winnings.
