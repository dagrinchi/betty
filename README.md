# Betty - AI Sports Betting Agent

Betty is an AI agent for sports betting with friends on Discord. It creates bets using smart contracts on Arbitrum Stylus, manages deposits via Metamask, and automates payouts with Chainlink resultsâ€”making group betting seamless and trustless.

## Features

- **Web3 Transactions:** Manages deposits and payouts via Metamask.
- **Automated Payouts:** Uses Chainlink to fetch match results and distribute funds.
- **Seamless Discord Experience:** No need for a traditional frontend; everything happens within Discord.

## How It Works
1. **Create a Bet:** A user sets up a bet in Discord with Betty's guidance.
2. **Smart Contract Deployment:** Betty generates a smart contract and a unique betting link.
